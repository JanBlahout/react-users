# React - Users

First application build only by me, made few changes to example one - you are able to remove the users by clicking on them.
If there are no users a messge is displayed to the user.
If no parameters are passed into the name or age input field a modal window pops up.

## What I learned

State, styling components by using module.css, how to implement and use modal window
Issues while deploying through netlify - reading logs

### Issue
Treating warnings as errors because process.env.CI = true.
Most CI servers set it automatically.

Failed to compile.
src/App.js
'dummyData' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars
